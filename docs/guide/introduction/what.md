# What is Möbius?

**Möbius** is a color palette generation tool designed for developers and designers who need quick, consistent, and attractive color schemes. It supports a wide variety of palette types and exports color data in multiple formats - RGB, HSL, LAB, CMYK, and more - making it ideal for both web design and data visualization.

The main feature is the ability to create palettes with a given primary color and a secondary color (used for diverging palettes). You can also give the color to diverge to/from.

::: info

This could be seen as an extension of [chroma.js](https://gka.github.io/chroma.js/), we use it under the hood for some of our functionality.

## They came first

All honours to the creators of [chroma.js](https://gka.github.io/chroma.js/) for making this possible, and [David Aerne's project `color-names`](https://github.com/meodai/color-names), for having a useable directory of (more or less) accurate color names.

## Developer Experience

**Möbius** is a ESM package, served through
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

It is Open Source, and easy to use.
