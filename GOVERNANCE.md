# Governance

moebius is a small open source project with a single maintainer. This document describes how decisions are made, who does what, and what happens if the maintainer can't continue.

## Model

The project follows a **maintainer-led** model: the maintainer makes the final decision on what goes into the project, guided by the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) and the discussion with contributors.

Decisions are made in public:

- **Proposals** are made as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/phun-ky/moebius/issues). Larger changes, such as breaking changes, are discussed in an issue before work starts.
- **Changes** are made as pull requests, reviewed by the maintainer, and merged only when the required checks pass.
- **Disagreements** are resolved by discussion in the issue or pull request. If that doesn't settle it, the maintainer decides and explains why.
- **Conduct** is governed by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which the maintainer enforces.

### Reviews

With one maintainer, a pull request by the maintainer has no second reviewer. The rules on `main` therefore require pull requests, resolved review threads and passing checks (lint, typecheck, tests, packaging, docs, dependency review, CodeQL and the DCO), but no approving review, and the maintainer can bypass them so that releases can push their commit and tag. Once there is a second maintainer, pull requests need an approving review from a maintainer other than the author.

| **Maintainer**  | Alexander Vassbotn Røyne-Helgesen ([@phun-ky](https://github.com/phun-ky)) | Sets the direction and roadmap; triages issues; reviews and merges pull requests; makes releases; handles security reports; enforces the Code of Conduct; manages the repository, the npm package and the documentation site |
| **Contributor** | Anyone who opens an issue or a pull request                                | Follows the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) and the Code of Conduct; includes tests with code changes                                                                                                                  |

### Becoming a maintainer

Contributors who have made sustained, high-quality contributions may be invited to become maintainers. A new maintainer gets write access to the repository and is added to this document, and from then on the project needs a review from a maintainer other than the author before merging.

Before anyone is given write access or any other escalated permission, such as publishing rights on npm, the maintainer reviews their contribution history and confirms that their GitHub account uses two-factor authentication. They get the lowest role that lets them do the work, and the change is recorded in the roles table above.

## Continuity

Today, one person holds everything needed to run the project: admin access to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/phun-ky/moebius), ownership of the [`@phun-ky/moebius` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@phun-ky/moebius) on npm, and the `möbius.dev` domain that serves the documentation.

- **Releases** are published from GitHub Actions with npm trusted publishing, so publishing needs no personal npm token, only access to the repository and the package.
- **The documentation** is built from the repository and deployed to GitHub Pages, so it can be rebuilt from any fork.
- **The code** is MIT-licensed. Anyone can fork it and continue the work under a new name if the project stops.
- **A second person with access** doesn't exist yet. Until there is one, the project can't continue under its own name if the maintainer is unavailable.
